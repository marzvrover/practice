# Practice

This is just a repo where I either test random things or make short projects to practice something. For example, it might be a simple "hello, world" in a language I haven't used in awhile. In fact, this README.md will be testing to make sure my new GPG setup will properly sign.

## Organization
I will organize this repo based off of what langauge the practice files are written in.
